-> # Here we create the TARGET section
-> # Define the user we want to execute, saying once connected to web server,
    # use the centos user
-> # Run everything as SUDO. This way we can AVOID passing the "-s" when executing the "ansible-playbook" command
-> # Define the CONNECTION type. EX: ssh
-> # Define FACTS. The default module used is SETUP unless specified.

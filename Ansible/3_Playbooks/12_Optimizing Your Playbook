--> RAW for Timestamp:
# RAW is used when we don't care of and just need that something RUN
# BUT to be able to show a JSON as RESULT, this must be changed
# RAW is NOT giving the possibility to REGISTER the RESULT (the advantage of it
#Â is to be able to PULL that RESULT is a nice JSON formatted )
# Use then DEBUG to show the RESULT

--> HANDLER for Apache:
# The Action "install the apache web server":
  -> If need to be run, will install apache and the HANDLER will be executed
  -> IF NOT, nothing will happen
# This way, we can delete Action:
  -> "start web service"

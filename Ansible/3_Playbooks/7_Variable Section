### IMPORTANT OF VARIABLES ###

-> Everything defined in a section such as "vars" or "vars_files"
   -> MUST be a LIST in case we are dealing with EXTERNAL stuff
      Ex. Files listed inside the VARS_FILES are externally defined

   -> NOT a LIST, in case are LOCALLY defined variable/parameters
      Ex. "playbook_version" inside the VARS section in LOCALLY defined

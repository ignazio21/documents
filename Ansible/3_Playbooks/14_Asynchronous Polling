# we need to run operations in PARALLEL to all the hosts designated
# we want to check when the command has SUCCESSED

1. change HOSTS to ALL
2. use ASYNC in the TASKS section to know when the command successed
  - run async, makes run n parallel, value is MAX time in millisecond ansible
    will wait for the command to complete
3. PULL indicates ansible how often to check

- hosts: all
....
  tasks:
    ....
    action: ..
    async: 300
    pull: 3
    notify: ...

4. RUN IT

# What are Playbooks?
# Conglomerations of commands conditions, variables and tests executing against
# one or more clients defined within a YAML file

# A YAML is a High-level key-value language

# Install lynx web browser locally

$ansible local -s -m shell -a 'yum install lynx'

# Getting closer to a playbook, use a more 'playbook' way to install packages
# To install lynx

# Use the YUM module, with SUDO (-s), take the PACKAGE lynx,
# make sure the STATE is INSTALLED, and UPDATE the CACHE REPOSITORY

$ansible web -s -m yum -a 'pkg=lynx state=installed update_cache=true'

# HOW TO CONVERT INTO A PLAYBOOK?

# Make a Playbook directory
# Create a YAML file

$ mkdir playbooks
$ vi playbooks/appserver.yaml

- hosts: appserver
  tasks:
  - name: Install Lynx on APP Servers
    yum: pkg=lynx state=installed update_cache=true


# RUN THE YAML FILE

$ansible-playbook -s appserver.yaml
